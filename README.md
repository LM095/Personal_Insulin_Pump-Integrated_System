# ðŸ’‰ðŸ©¸ Personal insulin pump (Integrated system)
>An embedded system in an insulin pump used by diabetics to maintain blood glucose control.



## :rocket: Introduction:

This work aims to define the operations of control software for an automated insulin pump which is used by diabetics to administer insulin.
It collects data from a blood sugar sensor and calculates the amount of insulin required to be injected.
The calculation is based on the rate of change of blood sugar levels, then it sends signals to a micro-pump to deliver the correct dose of insulin.
This is a safety-critical system as low blood sugars can lead to brain malfunctioning, coma and death; high-blood sugar levels have long-term consequences such as eye and kidney damage. 

### :computer: Hardware architecture:

The following parts are the ones developed in this work: 
* **Pump**
Pumps insulin from a reservoir to the needle assembly. It's in charge of deliver the correct amount of insulin computed by the controller to the needle assembly.
* **Controller**
Controls the entire system. This has two possible states: a run state and an error state. The latter state is triggered only when there are hardware issues.
* **Displays**
There are 3 displays. The first display displays system messages/hardware issues; the second one shows the last dose of insulin delivered and the last blood sugar measurement; the third one shows the current clock time.
* **Clock**
Provides the controller with the current time.

The **needle assembly**, the **alarm** and the **sensor** are just simulated: they do not provide real information to the system controller. In addiction, in order to provide a prototype, **hardware issues** are simulated. Therefore, they are all developed as mockups. 
In particular, the alarm component is simulated only using error messages displayed on the display. 

### :memo: Requirements

1. 	The dose of insulin to be delivered shall be computed by measuring the current level of blood sugar, comparing this to a previous measured level and computing the required dose as described in 3. below. 
2. 	The system shall measure the level of blood sugar and deliver insulin every 10 minutes.
3. The amount of insulin to be delivered shall be computed by the controller according to the current sugar reading as measured by the sensor:
	* If the reading is below the safe minimum, no insulin shall be delivered. See table 1 below.
	* If the reading is within the safe zone, then insulin is only delivered if the level of sugar is rising and the rate of increase of sugar level is increasing. The amount of insulin required is defined in the table 1 below.
	* If the reading is above the recommended level, insulin is delivered unless the level of blood sugar is falling and the rate of decrease of the blood sugar level is increasing. The amount of insulin required in this case is defined in the table 1 below.	
	* The amount of insulin actually delivered may be different from the computed dose as various safety constraints are included in the system. There is a limit on the maximum dose to be delivered in a single injection and a limit on the total cumulative dose in a single day.

**Table 1: conditions/actions for the insulin pump**
The following table is based on the last 3 blood sugar level measurements: in particular r0 indicates the oldest of the three measurements, r1 is the intermediate measurement and finally we have r2 which is the most recent measurement.

| Condition         | Action |
| --------          | -------- |
| a) Sugar level falling (r2 < r1)  | CompDose = 0 |
| b) Sugar level stable (r2 = r1) | CompDose = 0 |
| c) Sugar level increasing and rate of increase decreasing((r2 â€“ r1) < (r1 â€“ r0)) | CompDose = 0 |
| d) Sugar level increasing and rate of increase stable or increasing ((r2 â€“ r1) â‰¥ (r1 â€“ r0)) | CompDose = round ((r2 â€“ r1)/4)
| e) If rounded result = 0 | CompDose = MinimumDose|


4.	Under normal operating conditions, the system is in the "running" state.
5.	The controller shall run a self-test program every one minute. The result of the test is used to compute the new state:  if the test is 'true' (in case of an error) the new state become 'error', otherwise, if the test is 'false' (the device has not issues) the state remains 'running'. If the new state is 'error' (hardware issues) the system is suspended.
6. There are 3 displays. The first display displays system messages/hardware issues; the second one shows the last dose of insulin delivered and the last blood sugar measurement; the third one shows the current clock time.
7.	At the beginning of each 24 hour period, the cumulative dose of insulin delivered is reset to 0.
8.	A blood sugar sensor measures the current blood sugar reading in micrograms/millilitre. This is updated every 10 minutes and it is normally between 1 and 35 micrograms/millilitre.

The following sections are about the different scenarios regarding the system functionality.

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: 

Sugar level falling (r2 < r1):

**Initial assumption**: A user carries the personal insulin pump device. The device previously measured a blood sugar value, stored in r1.
The insulin pump device has no hardware issues (checked in the last minute).
**Normal**: Blood sugar level is measured by a blood sugar sensor and stored in a value r2. After the measurement, the controller checks the previous value (r1): the controller makes a comparison between the current value (r2) and the previous one (r1), and states that r2 is less than r1 (r2<r1). Than it computes the dose of insulin to inject (compDose), which is actually 0 U/ml. Since the compDose is 0, the controller does not activate the needle assembly to inject insulin.
**What can go wrong**: between the last hardware check (initial assumption) and the current blood sugar measurement it could have happened that a hardware issues occurred.
In this case, the controller must block all the system functionality.
**Other activities**: in the meantime the user are living their normal life and their blood sugar level is changing.
**System state on completion**: the controller updates the r-values: the current measurement r2 become r1, r1 become r0, and if there is a r0 value, this is discarded, in order to get ready for the next blood sugar measurement.

### Scenario 2: 

Sugar level stable (r2 = r1):

**Initial assumption**: A user carries the personal insulin pump device. The device previously measured a blood sugar value, stored in r1.
The insulin pump device has no hardware issues (checked in the last minute).
**Normal**: Blood sugar level is measured by a blood sugar sensor and stored in a value r2. After the measurement, the controller checks the previous value (r1): the controller makes a comparison between the current value (r2) and the previous one (r1), and states that r2 is equal than r1 (r2=r1). Than it computes the dose of insulin to inject (compDose), which is actually 0 U/ml. Since the compDose is 0, the controller does not activate the needle assembly to inject insulin.
**What can go wrong**: between the last hardware check (initial assumption) and the current blood sugar measurement it could have happened that a hardware issues occurred.
In this case, the controller must block all the system functionality.
**Other activities**: in the meantime the user are living their normal life and their blood sugar level is changing.
**System state on completion**: the controller updates the r-values: the current measurement r2 become r1, r1 become r0, and if there is a r0 value, this is discarded, in order to get ready for the next blood sugar measurement.

### Scenario 3: 

Sugar level increasing and rate of increase decreasing((r2 â€“ r1) < (r1 â€“ r0)):

**Initial assumption**: A user carries the personal insulin pump device. The device previously measured multiple blood sugar values, stored in r1 and r0. In particular r0 is the oldest measurement done. The insulin pump device has no hardware issues (checked in the last minute).
**Normal**: The blood sugar level is measured by a blood sugar sensor and stored in a value r2. After the measurement, the controller checks the previous value (r1): the controller makes a comparison between the current value (r2) and the previous one (r1) and states that r2>r1, i.e the sugar level is increasing.
The controller states the rate of increase starts to decrease: (r2 â€“ r1) < (r1 â€“ r0). So the dose of insulin to inject (compDose) is actually 0 U/ml. Since the compDose is 0, the controller does not activate the needle assembly to inject insulin.
**What can go wrong**: between the last hardware check (initial assumption) and the current blood sugar measurement it could have happened that a hardware issues occurred.
In this case, the controller must block all the system functionality.
**Other activities**: in the meantime the user are living their normal life and their blood sugar level is changing.
**System state on completion**: the controller updates the r-values: the current measurement r2 become r1, r1 become r0, and r0 is discarded, in order to get ready for the next blood sugar measurement.

### Scenario 4: 

Sugar level increasing and rate of increase stable or increasing ((r2 â€“ r1) â‰¥ (r1 â€“ r0)) and result of rounded division â‰  0

r2 = 35
r1 = 34
r0 = 33

35-34= 1 >= 34-33 = 1
1/4 = rounded(0.25) = 0 --> minDose = 1

r2 = 35
r1 = 1
r0 = 0

35-1=34 >= 1-0 = 1

34/4 = rounded(8.5) = 9

**Initial assumption**: A user carries the personal insulin pump device. The device previously measured multiple blood sugar values, stored in r1 and r0. In particular r0 is the oldest measurement done. The insulin pump device has no hardware issues (checked in the last minute).
**Normal**: The blood sugar level is measured by a blood sugar sensor and stored in a value r2. After the measurement, the controller checks the previous value (r1): the controller makes a comparison between the current value (r2) and the previous one (r1) and states that r2>r1, i.e the sugar level is increasing.
Since this level is increasing, the controller checks if the rate of increase is stable or it starts to decrease. In this scenario the rate of increase is stable or increasing ((r2 â€“ r1) â‰¥ (r1 â€“ r0)), so the dose of insulin to inject (compDose) is actually (r2 â€“ r1)/4 U/ml rounded to the nearest integer and not equal to 0.
Since the compDose is not equal to 0 (result of rounded division â‰  0), the controller activates the needle assembly to inject insulin.
**What can go wrong**: between the last hardware check (initial assumption) and the current blood sugar measurement it could have happened that a hardware issues occurred.
In this case, the controller must block all the system functionality.
**Other activities**: in the meantime the user are living their normal life and their blood sugar level is changing.
**System state on completion**: the controller updates the r-values: the current measurement r2 become r1, r1 become r0, and r0 is discarded, in order to get ready for the next blood sugar measurement.

### Scenario 5: 

Sugar level increasing and rate of increase stable or increasing ((r2 â€“ r1) â‰¥ (r1 â€“ r0)) and result of rounded division = 0

**Initial assumption**: A user carries the personal insulin pump device. The device previously measured multiple blood sugar values, stored in r1 and r0. In particular r0 is the oldest measurement done. The insulin pump device has no hardware issues (checked in the last minute).
**Normal**: The blood sugar level is measured by a blood sugar sensor and stored in a value r2. After the measurement, the controller checks the previous value (r1): the controller makes a comparison between the current value (r2) and the previous one (r1) and states that r2>r1, i.e the sugar level is increasing.
Since this level is increasing, the controller checks if the rate of increase is stable or it starts to decrease. In this scenario the rate of increase is stable or increasing ((r2 â€“ r1) â‰¥ (r1 â€“ r0)), so the dose of insulin to inject (compDose) is actually (r2 â€“ r1)/4 U/ml rounded to the nearest integer.
Since the compDose is equal to 0 (result of rounded division = 0), but the controller states an incresing sugar level, it activate the needly assembly to inject a fixed minimum dose (MinimumDose) of insulin.
**What can go wrong**: between the last hardware check (initial assumption) and the current blood sugar measurement it could have happened that a hardware issues occurred, i.e. one of the error in the Table 2.
In this case, the controller must block all the system functionality.
**Other activities**: in the meantime the user are living their normal life and their blood sugar level is changing.
**System state on completion**: the controller updates the r-values: the current measurement r2 become r1, r1 become r0, and r0 is discarded, in order to get ready for the next blood sugar measurement.

### Scenario 6: 

Hardware issues during the self-test or right before the blood sugar measurement, the insulin gathering, or the injection. 

**Initial assumption**: A user carries the personal insulin pump device. The device could have previously measured multiple blood sugar values. 
The insulin pump device has one or more hardware issues but the controller is not aware of it yet.
**Normal**: During the self-test or right before the blood sugar measurement, the insulin gathering or the injection, the controller makes a hardware test.
The controller states that there is a hardware issue, so it must stop all the current operations sending an error message to the user. The hardware test result is returned to the controller (is 'true' when there is an error).
**Other activities**: in the meantime the user are living their normal life and their blood sugar level is changing.
**System state on completion**: the controller has sent an error message to the user and the system is suspended.
